Cut wok holder out of 3/4 inch material. I used a 2' x 4' sheet of birch plywood from Home Depot. Finished cut size is 18"x24"

Once you cut, sand down the pieces. Sand the hook until it is a very tight fit in the hole. Hit with a mallet to seat all the way. Sand the back until it is flush with the back of the hook peg.

Stain or fill the grooves for the letters with epoxy to make them stand out more.
